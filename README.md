- **Supporting decision-making** for daily activities 🏃‍♂️, travel planning ✈️, and agriculture-related tasks 🚜.  

**Key Goals:**  
- Improve accessibility of weather information through a single platform 🌐.  
- Enable trend analysis and historical comparisons to understand climate patterns 📈.  
- Enhance user experience with intuitive visuals and interactive elements 🎨.  

**Impact:**  
By consolidating weather data and visualizing it effectively, the dashboard empowers users to make informed decisions ✅, reduces uncertainty caused by sudden weather changes ⚡, and increases awareness about local and global climate patterns 🌏.
